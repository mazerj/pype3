1. If you're installing for the first time, you need to install all
   the packages required to make pype3 build and run -- see
   ./Notes/dep-packages.txt for an explanation and
   ./Notes/dep-packages.sh for a script to install them all
   automatically.

2. Don't run make directly -- use the 'build' script in this
   directory to build/install/etc pype.
