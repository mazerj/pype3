Sampler Class for LabJack U3.

This basically provides a class that allows streaming
of data from a LabJack U3 device. The sampling runs
in a separte thread (note: potential for GIL blocking
here). The thread collects 4 channels of analog input
from the U3 and stores it synced to the host clock. Sync
is within 1ms (verified 03/27/2018 by cross correlation
against dacq4 comedi drivers).

While AIN data is streaming a second stream controls
the digital inputs and outputs, allowing pulses to be
generated and detected. Latency of DOUT is <1ms (verified
03/27/2018 by recording DOUT using dacq4/comedi).

AINO[0-3] are used for analog input (fixed on U3-HV)
FIO4: digital output 0
FIO5: digital output 1
FIO6: digital input 0
FIO7: digital input 1

Notes:
  - timestamps are in SECONDS
  - analog input is in VOLTS
	- AIN lines seem to float to ~1.5V when left open
	- VS reads +5V
	- GND reads 0V
  - Digital outputs go between 0 and 3.5V
  - Digital inputs float high

Problem:
  - there's a bizarre backwards time offset between the time at
	which the pulse is recorded and the timestamp when the pulse
	was generated, such that the pulse appears to be generated
	about 12ms AFTER it was recorded (at 2khz). It seems somewhat
	sampling rate dependent, but not in any obvious way. Nor is
	it consistent enough to correct for.
  - are signals being generated on DIN transitions? need to
    check. which thread gets the signal??
